      { title: "Picture to Burn", src: "Picture To Burn.mp3", lyrics: "State the obvious, I didn′t get my perfect fantasy\nI realise you love yourself more than you could ever love me\nSo go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy\nThat′s fine, you won't mind if I say\nAnd by the way\nI hate that stupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou're a redneck heartbreaker\nWho′s really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nAs far as I′m concerned you're\nJust another picture to burn\nThere′s no time for tears\nI'm just sitting here planning my revenge\nThere′s nothing stopping me\nFrom going out with all of your best friends\nAnd if you come around saying sorry to me\nMy daddy's gonna show you how sorry you′ll be\n'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou're a redneck heartbreaker\nWho′s really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nAs far as I′m concerned you're\nJust another picture to burn\nAnd if you′re missing me\nYou'd better keep it to yourself\n′Cause coming back around here\nWould be bad for your health\n'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou′re a redneck heartbreaker\nWho's really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nIn case you haven't heard\nI really, really hate that\nStupid old pickup truck\nYou never let me drive\nYou′re a redneck heartbreaker\nWho′s really bad at lying\nSo watch me strike a match\nOn all my wasted time\nAs far as I'm concerned you′re\nJust another picture to burn\nBurn, burn, burn, baby, burn\nYou're just another picture to burn\nBaby, burn\n" },

Don't know why I do\n\nDrew walks by me\nCan he tell that I can't breathe?\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be\n\nShe'd better hold him tight, give him all her love\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause\n\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nSo, I drive home alone\nAs I turn out the light\nI'll put his picture down\nAnd maybe get some sleep tonight\n\n'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heart\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into\n\nDrew looks at me\nI fake a smile so he won't see" },
