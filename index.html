Don't know why I do\n\nDrew walks by me\nCan he tell that I can't breathe?\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be\n\nShe'd better hold him tight, give him all her love\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause\n\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nSo, I drive home alone\nAs I turn out the light\nI'll put his picture down\nAnd maybe get some sleep tonight\n\n'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\nThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heart\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do\n\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into\n\nDrew looks at me\nI fake a smile so he won't see" },

too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, 'fuck the patriarchy'\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, 'It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one'\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\n\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n'I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age'\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it"}

Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room And every single one of your friends was making fun of you But 15 seconds later they were clapping too? Then what did you do? Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? When she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her?" },

Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife And she looks so pretty Driving in your Benz Lately she's been dressing for revenge" },

(Huh) I can reclaim the land And I miss you (I miss you) But I miss sparkling (ah, hey) Best believe I'm still bejeweled When I walk in the room I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer) And when I meet the band They ask, 'Do you have a man?' I can still say, 'I don't remember'" },

      { title: "Mastermind", src: "Mastermind.mp3", lyrics: "Once upon a time, the planets and the fates And all the stars aligned You and I ended up in the same room At the same time And the touch of a hand lit the fuse Of a chain reaction of countermoves To assess the equation of you Checkmate, I couldn't lose What if I told you none of it was accidental? And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me? I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork The dominoes cascaded in a line What if I told you I'm a mastermind? And now you're mine It was all by design 'Cause I'm a mastermind" },
      { title: "The Great War", src: "The Great War.mp3", lyrics: "My knuckles were bruised like violets Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked Spineless in my tomb of silence Tore your banners down, took the battle underground And maybe it was ego swinging Maybe it was her Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur All that bloodshed, crimson clover Uh-huh, sweet dream was over My hand was the one you reached for All throughout the Great War Always remember Uh-huh, tears on the letter I vowed not to cry anymore If we survived the Great War" },

No, I didn't but thanks though I'm so in love that I might stop breathing Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling No, I didn't see the news 'Cause we were somewhere in Paris We were somewhere in Paris (in Paris) We were somewhere in Paris You could be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor Every love I've known in comparison is a failure I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now Never be the same now, now" },
      { title: "High Infidelity", src: "High Infidelity.mp3", lyrics: "Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? Storm coming, good husband Bad omen Dragged my feet right down the aisle At the house lonely, good money I'd pay if you'd just know me Seemed like the right thing at the time You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love The slowest way is never loving them enough Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?" },

And if I was a child, did it matter If you got to wash your hands? Oh God rest my soul I miss who I used to be The tomb won't close Stained glass windows in my mind I regret you all the time I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep The wound won't close I keep on waiting for a sign I regret you all the time" },

I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy And all I did was bleed Try to lock the doors You're looking at me like I'm not your favorite town anymore I'm the best thing at this party (you're losing me) And I wouldn't marry me either (you're losing me) A pathological people pleaser (you're losing me) Who only wanted you to see her" }
